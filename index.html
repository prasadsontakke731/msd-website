                        <p>MS Dhoni probably ranks as the third-most popular Indian cricketer ever,
                            behind
                            only Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli.

                            to the top with a home-made <br>
                            batting and wicketkeeping technique, and a style of captaincy that scaled the highs and hit
                            the lows of both
                            conservatism and unorthodoxy.br <br>

                            Under Dhoni's leadership, India won the top prize in all formats: leading the Test rankings
                            for 18 months starting
                            December 2009, winning the 50-over World Cup in 2011, and the T20 world title on his
                            captaincy debut in 2007.


                            Along the way he showed leadership skills, which were recognised when Rahul Dravid gave up
                            the captaincy in 2007. A day
                            before that announcement from Dravid, a young India side under Dhoni played the first game

                            South Africa, and went on to win the tournament. The ODI captaincy was a natural
